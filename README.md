Este Pechito Comer Peruano is a full stack app where you can search your favorite peruavian restaurant in the world using the map in the explore restaurants tab, upload your photos and reviews of them. Also, you can upload your best photos of your home cooking, and share it with us. In the country space section, you will find the cookings of different people around the world.

Goals for this project:
Demonstrate the main digital skills I've learned at the Codaisseur Academy.
Build a full-stack web app from scratch into a working version within a two weeks.
Practice planning with user-stories, wireframes, datamodels, a kanban projectboard and git version control.
